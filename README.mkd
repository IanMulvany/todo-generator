# About.

Greps through a dirctory of txt files, and looks for @todo actions in those files.
Also looks for lines that start with "-" without @done or @todo. These are potential todos.

It then pops the results into a file, which has some format like the following:

[[source txt file]]

# Todos

- aklsdfjlka @todo asdf;ls
- asdfdsj @todo alksdfjas

# Potential todo

- alskdfjalsdk j
- aldskfaskldfj

# Completed items

- asldkfjalskdjf @done
- alsdkfjas @done
